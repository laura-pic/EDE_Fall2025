1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: 
I previously have used R and RStudio for data analysis required during my master's degree, where I was analyzing mostly quantitative deep-sea coral ages, growth rates, heights, widths, etc.
I have no experience with Git, but I am very interested in learning to use it as I think it would be very useful for my upcoming data analysis during my PhD work, especially so both myself and my advisor can see data from my experiments.
